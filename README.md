# Game Design
## Summary
The player is a fledgling Masker who is about to embark on a journey to become the world’s most renowned Masker. They meet many different Maskers and enemies along the way.
## Mindset
Player is goal oriented, and ambitious. Player can take their time to fulfill their goals, or speed up the achievement of them with in-app purchases. The player is able to play the game at their own pace, and for their own enjoyment, as they define their own goals within the game world they inhabit.
## Platforms
Journey is built for iOS and Android platforms.
## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to collect all the masks available. Obstacles are NPCs, enemies, other Maskers, and other players.
## Lore
Maskless are enemies that are causing bad times for everybody (they have hoods and you can’t see their face as they have no mask)
## Multiplayer
*Player has control of their own village, and other plays can visit it*
*Player can join parties and go on quests/adventures in overworld maps*
*Player can join guild and go on quests/adventures in overworld maps, as well as all guild members get access to a shared guild map that is only for their guild and they can customize it accordingly together in a shared ownership kind of way*
*All players can access and visit a centralized, global city that houses all players, this city would serve as a lobby of sorts.*
*Guilds can invade and attack other guild maps in real time*
## Art
*What kinds of colors will you be using? Do you have a limited palette to work with? A post-processed HSV map/image? Consistency is key for immersion.*

*What kind of graphic style are you going for? Cartoony? Pixel-y? Cute? How, specifically? Solid, thick outlines with flat hues? Non-black outlines with limited tints/shades? Emphasize smooth curvatures over sharp angles? Describe a set of general rules depicting your style here.*

*Well-designed feedback, both good (e.g. leveling up) and bad (e.g. being hit), are great for teaching the player how to play through trial and error, instead of scripting a lengthy tutorial. What kind of visual feedback are you going to use to let the player know they’re interacting with something? That they **can** interact with something?*
## Music
*Again, consistency is key. Define that consistency here. What kind of instruments do you want to use in your music? Any particular tempo, key? Influences, genre? Mood?*

*Stylistically, what kind of sound effects are you looking for? Do you want to exaggerate actions with lengthy, cartoony sounds (e.g. mario’s jump), or use just enough to let the player know something happened (e.g. mega man’s landing)? Going for realism? You can use the music style as a bit of a reference too.*
    
*Remember, auditory feedback should stand out from the music and other sound effects so the player hears it well. Volume, panning, and frequency/pitch are all important aspects to consider in both music and sounds - so plan accordingly!*
## Currency
The currency in the game is called Notes, and the player can earn them through taking on quests, defeating enemies, and selling their items to vendors or performing for the NPCs in the game. Notes can also be obtained via in-app purchase. *(maybe)*
