StoreKit Cross Promotion
------------------------

Integrate purchasing from Appleâ€™s iTunes, App and iBooks into your Unity3D application. This tutorial is not about in-app purchasing. Rather, it is about cross promoting your other products without having the user leave your application; this is great because users can purchase and download your other products from within your app! Most of the work is already done or you. All you have to do is pass in a dictionary of product IDs that you wish to promote.

Instructions:
1. Build And Run CrossPromotion.scene
