SocialTest is a demo project showing the native social sharing functionalities of the U3DXT Social by vitapoly.
It allows you to share using the native activity sheet or the direct social network API.

There are a few steps you need to take to get this working.

1. Make sure U3DXT.png has the correct settings:
    Texture Type: Advanced
    Read/Write Enabled: Checked
    Override for iPhone: Checked
    Format: RGBA 32 bit
2. If you want Facebook Direct API to work,	you will need to modify SocialTest.cs and replace facebookAppID with your app's Facebook App ID.
3. Build and run on device.
