ShareNearMe
-----------
		
This example shows you how to use Multipeer to share files, data, or resources.

More interestingly, you can enable WIFI w/internet access and bluetooth for the server and only enable bluetooth for the client. Then with just one line, you can have the server download a file from the internet and send it to the client over bluetooth connection only. It's kind of like a proxy server of sorts.

Instructions:
1. Build ShareNearMeServer.scene to one device, enable WIFI and bluetooth
2. Build ShareNearMeClient.scene to another device, disable WIFI, enable bluetooth
3. Connect and look at the debug consoles in XCode
